abstract = {Certain adaptive optics systems do not employ a wave front sensor but rather maximise a photodetector signal by appropriate control of an adaptive element. The maximisation procedure must be optimised if the system is to work efficiently. Such optimisation is often implementedempirically, but further insight can be obtained by using an appropriatemathematical model. In many practical systems aberrations can be accurately represented by a small number of modes of an orthogonal basis,such as the Zernike polynomials. By heuristic reasoning we develop a model for the operation of such systems and demonstrate a link with thegeometrical problems of sphere packings and coverings. This approach aidsthe optimisation of control algorithms and is illustrated by application todirect search and hill climbing algorithms. We develop an efficient schemeusing a direct maximisation calculation that permits the measurement of NZernike modes with only N $+$1 intensity measurements.},
