\section{Aberration Measurement and Correction}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%explain what are abberations, how they arrise, why it is good to correct them
%I just proposed a rough structure, but I am realizing now, that all the 
%sub-sub-section will take up a lot of room. so it might be better if you 
%remove them an explain it all in one subsection
%here is some stuff that I collected/copied from the paper you gave me

For the purpose of understanding the operation of an adaptive optical system, 
it is best to think of aberrations in terms of distortions of an optical 
wavefront.

        \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.4\textwidth}
                \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/wavefront_distortions_reflection}
                \caption{Reflection.}
                \label{fig:abberation_reflection}
        \end{subfigure}

                \label{fig:abberation_trans}
        \end{subfigure}
        \caption{Wavefront aberrations due to (a) reflection from a non 
planar surface and (b)  caused by propagation through a non-uniform 
refractive index distribution. Image after~\cite{Aberrations_book}.}

Representing aberrations in this way can simplify the design, control and 
characterisation of adaptive optics. The choice of modes for a particular 
application is often influenced by some aspect of the system, such as the 
deformation modes of a deformable mirror or the statistics of the induced 
aberrations. Otherwise, the modal representation may be chosen through 
mathematical convenience. For example, Zernike polynomials are often used for 
systems with circular apertures as they form a complete, orthogonal set of 
functions defined over a unit circle

As with all optical systems, microscopes can also suffer from aberrations due 
to imperfections in the optical components. In practice, no system can be 
totally free from aberrations and so systems are designed to maintain 
aberrations below a particular tolerance for a given set of imaging 
conditions, such as wavelength, magnification and field of view. Significant 
aberrations can be introduced if a microscope is used outside its design 
specifications, for example at the incorrect wavelength or at a difierent 
temperature (see Chapter 11 of Ref. 9).
