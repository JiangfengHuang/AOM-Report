\section{Adaptive Optics Methods applied in Microscopy}
\label{sec:ExperimentDiscussion}

Adaptive optics techniques have found their way into almost all kinds of modern, high resolution microscopy techniques. These microscopes have been combined with direct wavefront sensing and sensorless AO, using deformable mirrors or spatial light modulators for aberration compensation~(all of which has been described in Section~\ref{Measurement}. This includes standard widefield microscopes as well as highly sophisticated and specialized point scanning methods such as Coherent Antistokes Raman Spectroscopy~(CARS) and STimulated Emission Depletion~(STED) techniques. It has to be noted however, that some of these methods are themselves only a few years old. Therefor, they are still being optimized and so are the AOM techniques. It is therefore an interesting field of research with new ideas being implemented every year.\newline
AO was first used in confocal and two-photon fluorescence microscopy, both of which are commonly used in biomedical applications. These microscopes suffer from a significant drop in signal and resolution as the focus is moved deeper into the specimen, which is caused by aberrations.\cite{characterizing_abberations}

AOM is also used for imaging of live specimens. Due to an increased excitation signal and improved light collection from the specimen, acquisition times can be reduced and contrast can be enhanced. Techniques that without AO are to slow for live imaging might now be usable, opening up completely new fields of research. Another advantage of AO lies in the microscopy design. Using AO methods, can help the designer to relax the aberration tolerance. This permits a significant reduction in the complexity of the optical system while maintaining diffraction limited operation.

This section will describe, using state of the art examples, how AO is implemented in both widefield and point scanning systems.

\subsection{Widefield Microscopy}
\label{sec:WidefieldMicroscopy}

As mentioned above, AO techniques are being applied in widefield microscopy. In conventional microscopes, widefield illumination is provided using back light illumination or in the case of reflection or fluorescence modes, via the objective lens. The image quality depends only on the aberrations induced in the detection path and is independent of the aberrations of the illumination path. Aberration correction is therefore only necessary in the detection path and a single pass adaptive optics system will suffice~\cite{Aberrations_book}. Hence, the goal of AO for widefield microscopy is to restore the best possible imaging and to correct for aberrations induced both by an imperfect imaging system as well as by the imaged specimen. The latter becomes more important for thick biological samples where the light has to travel a larger distance through 
a medium with an inhomogeneous refractive index. 
This section describes how AO can be implemented in a standard transmission microscope~(Section~\ref{sec:TransmissionMicroscope}). Based on these early experiments, the same technique was then applied to structured light illumination~(Section~\ref{sec:StructuredIlluminationMicroscopy}), a specialized wide field technique. Further examples include AO used in both florescence~(Section~\ref{sec:FlourescnecMicroscopy}) and multifocal multiphoton microscopy~(Section~\ref{sec:MultifocalMultiphotonMicroscopy}). 

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Transmission Microscope}
\label{sec:TransmissionMicroscope}
To implement adaptive optics with standard (incoherent) transmission microscopes, \emph{Debarre et al.}~\cite{wide_AOM_loew_freq} implement an indirect, sensorless and image-based adaptive optics scheme, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:widefield_simple_microscope}. As described earlier in Section~\ref{sec:IndirectWavefrontSensing}, image-based techniques do not require an additional wavefront sensor but retrieve the correction data directly form the recorded images. As with all indirect sensing schemes, the difficulty is to find a good metric for image quality, which allows to determine the appropriate correction parameters.

\begin{figure}[htb]
	\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.50\textwidth]{images/widefield_simple_microscope.pdf}
	\caption{Schematic diagram of the experimental setup, showing a simple microscope complemented with a deformable mirror for aberration correction. Image after~\cite{wide_AOM_loew_freq}.}
	\label{fig:widefield_simple_microscope}
\end{figure}

The presented method uses low spatial frequency content of the image as the optimization metric. The aberration is represented in terms of so called Lukosz modes. Like Zernike polynomials, the Lukosz functions are each expressed as the product of a radial polynomial and an azimuthal function. The presented technique is based on modeling the effects of aberrations on the imaging of low spatial frequencies, which Lukosz modes are are found to be ideal for.

\noindent By modeling the aberration $\Phi(r)$ as a series of $N$ Lukosz modes $L_i(r,\phi)$ with coefficients $a_i$~\cite{wide_Lukosz_Modes}:
\begin{align}
	\Phi(r) = \sum_{i=4}^{N+3}{a_i L_i(r,\phi)},
	\label{eq:aberration_expansion_Lukosz}
\end{align}
they develop the optimization metric $g$ as the sum of a range of low frequencies. It is related to the coefficients of the aberration expansion, $a_i$ by the Lorentzian function~\cite{wide_AOM_loew_freq}
\begin{align}
	g(a_i) \approx \frac{1}{q_0 + q_1 \sum_{i=4}^{N+3}{a_i^2}}
	\label{eq:aberration_metric}
\end{align}
where the piston, tip and tilt modes ($i = 1,2,3$ respectively) have been omitted and $q_0$ and $q_1$ are both positive quantities in the frequency range of interest. The aberration correction process is then performed as the maximization of $g(a_i)$. Because of this particular aberration expansion and  optimization metric, the function $g(a_i)$ shows a paraboloidal maximum that permits the use of simple maximization algorithms. Furthermore, it is shown that the optimization can be performed as a sequence of independent maximizations for each aberration coefficient.

The third row illustrates schematically the sampling of the Lorentzian curve used in the optimization calculation. (a1-a3) correspond to an arbitrary initial aberration of magnitude, (b1-b3) have an additional negative bias while (c1-c3) have an additional positive bias of equal magnitude. (d1- d3) show the corrected image calculated with the parabolic minimizationn. Image after~\cite{wide_AOM_loew_freq}.}
	\label{fig:para_opt}
\end{figure} 

The correction process is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:para_opt} for the correction of a single Lukosz mode using a scatterer specimen. Using the deformable mirror (DM), an initial aberration $a_i$ is applied and an image is recorded. The Fourier transform and spectral density of the image are then calculated and the appropriate range of frequency components are summed, giving the metric measurements $g_0$. The same procedure is repeated with both negative and positive aberrations~(i.e. stronger and weaker aberrations), resulting in the metric measurements $g_-$ and  $g_+$. Due to the paraboilc maximum of \eqref{eq:aberration_metric}, the value of $a_i$ that minimizes $g$ can be calculated from as little as three measurements of $g(a_i)$. The optimum correction aberration can then estimated by parabolic minimization as~\cite{wide_parabolic_optimization}:
\begin{align}
	a_\text{corr} = \frac{b(g_+ - g_-)}{2g_+ - 4g_0 + 2g_-}
\end{align}
and is then applied to the DM. To correct multiple modes, each modal coefficient is measured in the same manner before the full correction aberration containing all modes is applied. While this technique is based only on low spatial frequencies, it is shown that both low and high frequency components can be effectively corrected. In all the cases investigated, a Strehl ratio greater than 0.8, close to the diffraction limit, was obtained. This indicates that, when aberration statistics are unknown, choosing small spatial frequencies for an initial correction is a reasonable strategy. If further correction is required,they can be performed using a larger range of frequencies. \emph{Debarre et al.} conclude that this correction scheme is largely independent of the object structure and propose that this approach also to be valid for coherent or partially coherent systems.


%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Structured Illumination Microscopy}
\label{sec:StructuredIlluminationMicroscopy}

It is often desired for biological samples to produce clear images of focal planes deep within a thick sample (i.e. optical sectioning) and common techniques include point-scanning techniques such as confocal or multiphoton techniques which are described in Section~\ref{sec:PointScanningMicroscopes}. 

%TODO
Widefield techniques such as Structured Illumination (SI) microscopy can also provide optical sectioning. However, there the sectioning is realized using a standard microscopes, an incoherent light source and without the need for a scanning mechanism. For SI microscopy, a grid is imaged into the specimen to produce a one-dimensional sinusoidal excitation pattern in the focal plane. The resulting sinusoidal fluorescence image, consisting of both in- focus and out-of-focus fluorescence emission, is then normally recorded. Several images are taken, each corresponding to a different grid position \textbf{(vertical or horizontal grid shift???)}. The grid pattern only appears in the focal plane while it is blurred in the out of focus regions. Hence, it is possible to extract an optical section from the spatially modulated component of the images via a simple calculation.

Based on the SI microscopy technique presented by \emph{Neil et al.} in 2005~\cite{wide_structured_illu_principle} as well as their earlier work on indirect wavefront sensing using a conventional microscope~\cite{wide_AOM_loew_freq} in 2007~(described in the previous section) \emph{Debarre et al.} combined both techniques in 2008 and proposed an AO scheme for use in SI microscopy~\cite{wide_AOM_structured_illu}.  

\begin{figure}
	\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{images/wide_structured_illumination.pdf}
	\caption{Experimental setup for structured illumination microscopy with 
aberration correction. WLS~-~white light source, DM~-~deformable mirror, DBS
~-~dichroic beamsplitter. The blue rays mark the illumination path; the 
detection path is shown in yellow. Image after~\cite{wide_AOM_structured_illu}
.}
	\label{fig:wide_structured_illumination}
\end{figure}

They again present a sensorless wavefront detection scheme, which is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:wide_structured_illumination}. The method to obtain the aberration correction is similar to the one presented and explained in the previous section. 
The authors derive an inner product from a mathematical model of the imaging process, followed by an orthogonalization process applied to a set of Zernike polynomials. Based on that, a general method providing an optimal aberration expansion for the chosen optimization metric is presented. This process yields  information about the effects of different aberration modes in of the SI microscope. \emph{Debarre et al.} show that the image quality mainly depends on the imaging efficiency spatial frequency of the illumination pattern. This imaging efficiency is affected much more by some aberration modes~(called grid modes) than by others~(called non-grid modes) . Grid modes have a significant influence on the intensity of the sectioned image, whereas non-grid modes have comparatively little effect. The non-grid modes do however affect the resolution. 

The results of the implemented AO scheme is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:structured_light_correction} for aberration correction on a fluorescent mouse intestine. The image contrast and sharpness improvement is clearly visible in image~\ref{fig:SI_corrected} compared to the uncorrected image in \ref{fig:SI_uncorrected}. As a result of the aberration correction, and as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:SI_scan}, the contrast of small sample features (blue arrows) is better defined after (red solid line) rather than before (black dotted line) correction. 

\begin{figure}[tbh]

line) correction. The imaging depth was approximately $\unit[10]{\upmu}$, 
sacle bar size $\unit[10]{\upmu}$. Image after~\cite{wide_AOM_structured_illu}
.}
\label{fig:structured_light_correction}
\end{figure} 

The authors also explain an additional benefit of aberration correction for structured illumination microscopy. That the adaptive element can also be used to improve the rejection of the out-of-focus fluorescence. When imaging thick specimen, noise fluctuations in the fluorescence signal between the three successive widefield images obtained for the maximization process result in a large out-of-focus background in the calculated sectioned images. Since this background arises from fluorescence generated outside the focal plane, it is not  sensitive to the presence of aberrations. By applying large aberrations in a number of grid modes, the grid pattern is suppressed and only the out-of-focus noise can be measured. By subtracting this aberrated image from the original sectioned image, the fluorescent background can be efficiently removed, leading to greatly improved contrast of the in-focus structures.

The aberrations can also change significantly with depth and hence using the same correction for different depths can result in a degradation of the image quality.  The correction can however be adapted for different imaging depths in the sample. This permits improvement of the image quality throughout an axially extended sample.
It is furthermore possible to determined the appropriate modes once and use the same scheme for any specimen, as the scheme is mostly independent of the object structure. Alternatively, if one wants to correct for local variations in aberrations the image could be formed from several sub-images for which independent aberration correction would be performed.

%TODO is this technique applied in Point Scanning Techniques? 
In conclusion, the authors present a sophisticated, easy to implement and highly versatile AOM scheme which allows for aberration correction induced by the optical system, the specimen or the focus depth. While the presented scheme uses a widefield microscope, \emph{Debarre et al.} are also optimistic that similar AO methods based on indirect, image based aberration detection can be applied to point-scanning methods.

\subsubsection{Fluorescence Microscopy}
\label{sec:FlourescnecMicroscopy}

next section, all from \cite{wide_AOM_FM_spehrical_correction} uses a 
standard widefield flourescene microscope but use AOM to correct for 
spherical aberration due to depth -> no specimen induce correction
uses deconvolution to get out of foucs photons corrected

In this paper, we concentrate on the depth dependent aberration which can 
quickly become serious. Imaging 20 mum a live sample (index of refraction 1.36
) with an oil immersion lens causes the peak intensity of the point spread 
function (PSF) to drop 3-fold and the width of the PSF in the axial direction 
to increase by 2-folds. \cite{wide_AOM_FM_spehrical_correction} 

Because wide-field microscopy captures as efficiently as possible every 
emitted photon ultimately minimizing the sample excitation dose, it is well 
suited to in vivo imaging in samples where scattering is not too large. 
Although the out-of-focus photons are in the wrong place, they can be 
effectively re-assigned to the location of emission by constrained 
deconvolution algorithms \cite{wide_deconvolution}

The problem of depth aberrations can be solved by matching the sample index 
and the index of the immersion medium, but this is frequently not feasible or 
desirable. For example, the index of fixed cells can be matched to that of 
the immersion oil, but this option is not available for live imaging.

An important drawback to most schemes that have been proposed so far is that 
they require several images to be taken to optimize the aberration 
correction. This presents a serious problem for live imaging in biology 
because the fluorescence intensities can be weak and susceptible to rapid 
bleaching.

The approach we follow is to correct the depth aberrations withanopen-loop 
predictive algorithm similar totheapproach taken by Potsaid et al. in 
correcting off-axis aberrations. This is possible because the depth 
aberration can be calculated for a given depth into the sample. The depth 
aberration is the result of depth-dependent path length differences.

Correcting depth aberrations with a DM improves both the peak intensities and 
the deconvolution of images taken below the cover slip by removing the depth 
aberration. This allows the use of fast space-invariant deconvolution 
algorithms instead of depth-dependent algorithms. This is significant because 
it improves both the signal-to-noise ratio and the resolution in biological 
imaging where photons are in short supply. Unfortunately, the performance 
does not yet achieve what is theoretically possible.

\begin{figure}[htb]
	\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.80\textwidth]{images/wide_flour_spher_All.jpg}
	\caption{Images of a $\unit[200]{nm}$ bead $\unit[67]{\upmu m}$ below the 
cover slip in a water/glycerol mixture with n = 1.42.  (a) Uncorrected image 
of in-focus plane. (b) Corrected image of in-focus plane. Images (c) and (d) 
are the same as (a) and (b), respectively, but on a logarithmic scale for 
better visualization. (e) and (f) are line profiles of the intensity through 
the center of the bead along the lateral and the longitudinal axis, 
respectively. The dashed line is from the uncorrected image and the solid 
line is from the corrected image. (g) and (h) are simulations of the PSF. 
Images based on \cite{wide_AOM_FM_spehrical_correction}.}
	\label{fig:wide_flour_spher_All} 
\end{figure}


The first is the effect of uncorrected aberrations from the sample and the 
optical path, which decrease the maximum intensity at the cover slip, but in 
a way that does not add linearly to the depth aberration. Thus only a 
fraction of the dispersed photons can be restored to the central peak. In 
closed loop AO systems, system aberrations are automatically compensated at 
each position (Wright et al., 2007), but in an open-loop system this is not 
possible. The second factor is the inability of the mirror to precisely 
conform to the shape given by Eq. (1). The residual error of the mirror shape 
increases with depth (see Fig. 3c) so that as the imaging plane goes deeper 
and the possibility for improvement becomes greater, the improvement in peak 
intensities decreases

Lastly, the ultimate goal of applying adaptive optics in microscopy is to 
correct all aberrations including those introduced by the refractive index 
variations of the sample itself.

%Do I really want this???

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Point Scanning Microscopes}
\label{sec:PointScanningMicroscopes}

Scanning optical microscopes are widely used for high resolution imaging, 
mainly because certain implementations provide three-dimensional resolution 
with optical sectioning and are thus particularly useful for imaging the 
volume structures of biological specimensz. In these microscopes, 
illumination is provided by a laser that is focused by an objective lens into 
the specimen. The light emitted from the specimen is collected, usually 
through the same objective lens, and its intensity is measured by a single 
photodetector. The focal spot is scanned through the specimen in a raster 
pattern and the image is acquired in a point-by-point fashion. The resulting 
data are stored and rendered as images in a computer.

Several other point scanning microscope modalities have been introduced, 
including two-photon excitation uorescence (TPEF) microscopy, second harmonic 
generation (SHG) and third harmonic generation (THG) microscopy, and coherent 
anti-Stokes Raman (CARS) microscopy.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsubsection{Confocal Microscopes}
\label{sec:ConfocalMicroscopes}

The most common example of this type is the confocal microscope, which can be 
operated in reflection or fluorescence mode. Three-dimensional resolution is 
achieved by the placement of a pinhole in front of the photodetector. In a 
reflection mode confocal microscope, the illumination is scattered by objects 
not only in the focal region, but throughout the focusing cone. In 
fluorescence mode, emission is generated in the focus but also in out-of-
focus regions. The pinhole ensures that mainly light from the focal region 
falls upon the detector and light from out-of-focus planes is obscured. It is 
critical in the confocal microscope that both the illumination and detection 
paths are diffraction limited. This ensures that i) the illuminating focal 
spot is as small as possible, and ii) that the focus is perfectly imaged on 
to the detector pinhole. Therefore, in an adaptive confocal microscope, 
aberration correction must be included in both paths. This dual pass adaptive 
system can usually be implemented using a single deformable mirror, if the 
path length aberrations are the same for both the illumination and the 
emission light. This is the case if there is no significant dispersion in the 
specimen or chromatic aberration in the optics.

A pinhole is not required to obtain three-dimensional resolution, so most 
TPEF microscopes use large area detectors to maximise signal collection. 
Although they rely upon other physical processes, non-linear imaging 
modalities such as SHG, THG and CARS exhibit similar resolution properties. 
When using large area detectors, the fidelity of imaging in the detection 
path is unimportant so the effects of any aberrations in this path are 
negated. It follows that single pass adaptive optics is appropriate for these 
microscopes as aberration correction need only be implemented in the 
illumination path.

Adaptive optics systems have been successfully combined with several point-
scanning microscope systems including confocal,13 TPEF,6, 14, 15 harmonic 
generation,16, 17 CARS.18 Example images of aberration correction in an 
adaptive THG microscope are shown in Fig. 10.
