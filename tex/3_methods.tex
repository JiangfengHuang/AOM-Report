\section{Adaptive Optics Methods applied in Microscopy}
\label{sec:ExperimentDiscussion}

Adaptive optics techniques have found their way into almost all kinds of modern, high resolution microscopy techniques. These microscopes have been combined with direct wavefront sensing and sensorless AO, using deformable mirrors or spatial light modulators for aberration compensation~(all of which has been described in Section~\ref{Measurement}. This includes standard widefield microscopes as well as highly sophisticated and specialized point scanning methods such as Coherent Antistokes Raman Spectroscopy~(CARS) and STimulated Emission Depletion~(STED) techniques. It has to be noted however, that some of these methods are themselves only a few years old. Therefor, they are still being optimized and so are the AOM techniques. It is therefore an interesting field of research with new ideas being implemented every year.\newline
AO was first used in confocal and two-photon fluorescence microscopy, both of which are commonly used in biomedical applications. These microscopes suffer from a significant drop in signal and resolution as the focus is moved deeper into the specimen, which is caused by aberrations.\cite{characterizing_abberations}

AOM is also used for imaging of live specimens. Due to an increased excitation signal and improved light collection from the specimen, acquisition times can be reduced and contrast can be enhanced. Techniques that without AO are to slow for live imaging might now be usable, opening up completely new fields of research. Another advantage of AO lies in the microscopy design. Using AO methods, can help the designer to relax the aberration tolerance. This permits a significant reduction in the complexity of the optical system while maintaining diffraction limited operation.

This section will describe, using state of the art examples, how AO is implemented in both widefield and point scanning systems.

\subsection{Widefield Microscopy}
\label{sec:WidefieldMicroscopy}

As mentioned above, AO techniques are being applied in widefield microscopy. In conventional microscopes, widefield illumination is provided using back light illumination or in the case of reflection or fluorescence modes, via the objective lens. The image quality depends only on the aberrations induced in the detection path and is independent of the aberrations of the illumination path. Aberration correction is therefore only necessary in the detection path and a single pass adaptive optics system will suffice~\cite{Aberrations_book}. Hence, the goal of AO for widefield microscopy is to restore the best possible imaging and to correct for aberrations induced both by an imperfect imaging system as well as by the imaged specimen. The latter becomes more important for thick biological samples where the light has to travel a larger distance through 
a medium with an inhomogeneous refractive index. 
This section describes how AO can be implemented in a standard transmission microscope~(Section~\ref{sec:TransmissionMicroscope}). Based on these early experiments, the same technique was then applied to structured light illumination~(Section~\ref{sec:StructuredIlluminationMicroscopy}), a specialized wide field technique. Further examples include AO used in both florescence~(Section~\ref{sec:FlourescnecMicroscopy}) and multifocal multiphoton microscopy~(Section~\ref{sec:MultifocalMultiphotonMicroscopy}).

\subsubsection{Transmission Microscope}
\label{sec:TransmissionMicroscope}
To implement adaptive optics with standard (incoherent) transmission microscopes, \emph{Debarre et al.}~\cite{wide_AOM_loew_freq} implement an indirect, sensorless and image-based adaptive optics scheme, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:widefield_simple_microscope}. As described earlier in Section~\ref{sec:IndirectWavefrontSensing}, image-based techniques do not require an additional wavefront sensor but retrieve the correction data directly form the recorded images. As with all indirect sensing schemes, the difficulty is to find a good metric for image quality, which allows to determine the appropriate correction parameters.

\begin{figure}[htb]
	\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.50\textwidth]{images/widefield_simple_microscope.pdf}
	\caption{Schematic diagram of the experimental setup, showing a simple microscope complemented with a deformable mirror for aberration correction. Image after~\cite{wide_AOM_loew_freq}.}
	\label{fig:widefield_simple_microscope}
\end{figure}

The presented method uses low spatial frequency content of the image as the optimization metric. The aberration is represented in terms of so called Lukosz modes. Like Zernike polynomials, the Lukosz functions are each expressed as the product of a radial polynomial and an azimuthal function. The presented technique is based on modeling the effects of aberrations on the imaging of low spatial frequencies, which Lukosz modes are are found to be ideal for.

\noindent By modeling the aberration $\Phi(r)$ as a series of $N$ Lukosz modes $L_i(r,\phi)$ with coefficients $a_i$~\cite{wide_Lukosz_Modes}:
\begin{align}
	\Phi(r) = \sum_{i=4}^{N+3}{a_i L_i(r,\phi)},
	\label{eq:aberration_expansion_Lukosz}
\end{align}
they develop the optimization metric $g$ as the sum of a range of low frequencies. It is related to the coefficients of the aberration expansion, $a_i$ by the Lorentzian function~\cite{wide_AOM_loew_freq}
\begin{align}
	g(a_i) \approx \frac{1}{q_0 + q_1 \sum_{i=4}^{N+3}{a_i^2}}
	\label{eq:aberration_metric}
\end{align}
where the piston, tip and tilt modes ($i = 1,2,3$ respectively) have been omitted and $q_0$ and $q_1$ are both positive quantities in the frequency range of interest. The aberration correction process is then performed as the maximization of $g(a_i)$. Because of this particular aberration expansion and  optimization metric, the function $g(a_i)$ shows a paraboloidal maximum that permits the use of simple maximization algorithms. Furthermore, it is shown that the optimization can be performed as a sequence of independent maximizations for each aberration coefficient.

(d1- d3) show the corrected image calculated with the parabolic minimizationn. Image after~\cite{wide_AOM_loew_freq}.}
	\label{fig:para_opt}
\end{figure} 

The correction process is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:para_opt} for the correction of a single Lukosz mode using a scatterer specimen. Using the deformable mirror (DM), an initial aberration $a_i$ is applied and an image is recorded. The Fourier transform and spectral density of the image are then calculated and the appropriate range of frequency components are summed, giving the metric measurements $g_0$. The same procedure is repeated with both negative and positive aberrations~(i.e. stronger and weaker aberrations), resulting in the metric measurements $g_-$ and  $g_+$. Due to the paraboilc maximum of \eqref{eq:aberration_metric}, the value of $a_i$ that minimizes $g$ can be calculated from as little as three measurements of $g(a_i)$. The optimum correction aberration can then estimated by parabolic minimization as~\cite{wide_parabolic_optimization}:
\begin{align}
	a_\text{corr} = \frac{b(g_+ - g_-)}{2g_+ - 4g_0 + 2g_-}
\end{align}
and is then applied to the DM. To correct multiple modes, each modal coefficient is measured in the same manner before the full correction aberration containing all modes is applied. While this technique is based only on low spatial frequencies, it is shown that both low and high frequency components can be effectively corrected. In all the cases investigated, a Strehl ratio greater than 0.8, close to the diffraction limit, was obtained. This indicates that, when aberration statistics are unknown, choosing small spatial frequencies for an initial correction is a reasonable strategy. If further correction is required,they can be performed using a larger range of frequencies. \emph{Debarre et al.} conclude that this correction scheme is largely independent of the object structure and propose that this approach also to be valid for coherent or partially coherent systems.

\subsubsection{Structured Illumination Microscopy}
\label{sec:StructuredIlluminationMicroscopy}

%next part all from
\cite{wide_AOM_structured_illu}

all from \cite{wide_AOM_loew_freq} which \cite{wide_AOM_structured_illu} is based on, i.e. where it is the more advandced topic

Optical sectioning microscopy is widely used to provide three-dimensional 
fluorescence images of biological specimens. A common way of obtaining this 
sectioning ability is through point scanning methods such as confocal or 
multiphoton microscopy [1, 2]. An alternative is to use a wide-field 
technique such as structured illumination (SI) microscopy, which retains the 
sectioning ability of confocal microscopy, but can be implemented in a 
conventional microscope using an incoherent light source, and without the 
need for scanning. 

In this technique, the image of a grid is projected on the specimen so as to 
produce a one-dimensional sinusoidal excitation pattern in the focal plane of 
the objective lens. The resulting fluorescence image, consisting of both in-
focus and out-of-focus fluorescence emission, is acquired by a camera. 
Several images are taken, each corresponding to a different grid position. As 
the grid pattern appears only in the focal plane, it is possible to extract 
an optical section from the spatially modulated component of the images via a 
simple calculation.~\cite{wide_structured_illu_principle}.

In this paper we describe wavefront sensorless adaptive optics implemented in 
a SI microscope. It is shown that the final image quality depends 
predominantly on the imaging efficiency of the illumination pattern’s spatial 
frequency. This imaging efficiency is affected much more by some aberration 
modes than by others. Consequently, different aberration modes can have 
significantly different effects on the final sectioned image.

The SI microscope relies upon the projection of a physical grid pattern into 
the focal plane of the specimen. We assume that the grid object is a 
sinusoidal transmission mask

those aberrations that affect the grid frequency have the most significant 
effect on the SI microscope. It is therefore useful to separate aberration 
modes into two groups: those that affect the grid frequency (referred to 
hereon as “grid modes”) and those that have no influence on this frequency (
“non-grid modes”). It is clear that grid modes have a significant influence 
on the intensity of the sectioned image, whereas non-grid modes have 
comparatively little effect. The non-grid modes do however affect the 
resolution.

%3. Derivation of a general optimisation scheme 
The specification of a modal aberration correction scheme requires the choice 
of three components: the aberration representation (the mathematical 
functions used to describe the aberrations), the optimisation metric (a 
quantity representing the image quality) and the estimator (the algorithm for 
estimating the correction aberration).

We would like to choose a metric function M whose maximum corresponds to the 
highest quality image.
find an aberration expansion for which the modes act independently on the 
metric.
This would allow the independent optimisation of each mode.
When M is expressed in this form, it is clear that independent maximisation 
with respect to each xi is possible. Furthermore, as the function is 
quadratic, the maximum can be found directly from three measurements of M 
corresponding to three different values of xi - here they reference to \cite{
wide_AOM_loew_freq} so maybe I should put the two together, or see this one 
as a more advandced version of the previous
\begin{align}
	M = M_0 - \sum_i{x_i^2}
	\label{eq:structured_metric}
\end{align}
In practice, these measurements would be taken with three different trial 
aberrations introduced by the correction element. However, M only takes the 
form shown in Eq.~\eqref{eq:structured_metric} if the aberration 
representation is appropriately chosen. 

for each aberration mode, the metric M was measured when adding a given 
amount of the considered mode, then again when substracting the same amount. 
Along with the measured value of M when no aberration was added, this allowed 
us to estimate the initial aberration present in each of the assessed modes 
and hence to correct these aberrations

Here we want to emphasise that the use of the appropriate metric and 
aberration modes means that the correction of N modes was performed using 
only 2N+1 measurements, thereby minimizing the increase in illumination time 
of the sample required for the correction.

The acquisition time per sectioned image was 300-500ms and the total time 
required for correction of 11 modes was 7-12s, depending on the sample.


However, M only takes the form shown in Eq. ( 10) if the aberration 
representation is appropriately chosen.


We are therefore led to the conclusion that the SI microscope, in comparison 
to other sectioning microscopes, is more susceptible to certain aberrations (
grid modes) and more resilient to others (non-grid modes).

Whilst the SI microscope relies upon a relatively simple optical principle, 
the image formation process has a complex mathematical description. 
Similarly, the derivation of a modelbased, sensorless, adaptive optical 
scheme is a complex process. However, our results show that the scheme is 
effective in correcting specimen-induced and system aberrations and restoring 
image quality. For the samples presented here, we found that the aberration 
mainly consisted of astigmatism, coma and spherical aberration modes.

The adaptive scheme described here has significant advantages over model-free 
algorithms in that the aberration correction can be estimated using a small 
number of measurements (2N+1 for N aberration modes). Moreover, as the scheme 
is mostly independent of the object structure, the appropriate modes have 
only to be determined once and the same scheme can be used for any 
specimen.We have also shown that aberration correction can be effectively 
combined with background subtraction to further improve SI microscope images. 
In the results presented here, aberration correction was performed as an 
average over an image frame and therefore would not correct for any local 
variations in aberrations. If these variations were found to be significant, 
the image could be formed from several sub-images for which independent 
aberration correction would be performed.

We have presented a general method that provides an optimal aberration 
expansion for a chosen optimisation metric. This relied upon the derivation 
of an inner product from a mathematical model of the imaging process, 
followed by an orthogonalisation process applied to a set of basis functions, 
such as the Zernike functions. This process reveals a wealth of information 
about the effects of different aberration modes on an imaging system – for 
the SI microscope, it enabled us to derive the sets of grid modes and non-
grid modes. \textbf{This method could equally be applied to any sectioning 
microscope to derive aberration expansions that are best suited to that 
application.

\subsubsection{Fluorescence Microscopy}
\label{sec:FlourescnecMicroscopy}

next section, all from \cite{wide_AOM_FM_spehrical_correction} uses a 
standard widefield flourescene microscope but use AOM to correct for 
spherical aberration due to depth -> no specimen induce correction
uses deconvolution to get out of foucs photons corrected

In this paper, we concentrate on the depth dependent aberration which can 
quickly become serious. Imaging 20 mum a live sample (index of refraction 1.36
) with an oil immersion lens causes the peak intensity of the point spread 
function (PSF) to drop 3-fold and the width of the PSF in the axial direction 
to increase by 2-folds. \cite{wide_AOM_FM_spehrical_correction} 

Because wide-field microscopy captures as efficiently as possible every 
emitted photon ultimately minimizing the sample excitation dose, it is well 
suited to in vivo imaging in sampleswhere scattering is not too large. 
Although the out-of-focus photons are in thewrong place, they can be 
effectively re-assigned to the location of emission by constrained 
deconvolution algorithms \cite{wide_deconvolution}

The problem of depth aberrations can be solved by matching the sample index 
and the index of the immersion medium, but this is frequently not feasible or 
desirable. For example, the index of fixed cells can be matched to that of 
the immersion oil, but this option is not available for live imaging.

An important drawback to most schemes that have been proposed so far is that 
they require several images to be taken to optimize the aberration 
correction. This presents a serious problem for live imaging in biology 
because the fluorescence intensities can be weak and susceptible to rapid 
bleaching.

The approach we follow is to correct the depth aberrations withanopen-loop 
predictive algorithm similar totheapproach taken by Potsaid et al. in 
correcting off-axis aberrations. This is possible because the depth 
aberration can be calculated for a given depth into the sample. The depth 
aberration is the result of depth-dependent path length differences.

Correcting depth aberrations with a DM improves both the peak intensities and 
the deconvolution of images taken below the cover slip by removing the depth 
aberration. This allows the use of fast space-invariant deconvolution 
algorithms instead of depth-dependent algorithms. This is significant because 
it improves both the signal-to-noise ratio and the resolution in biological 
imaging where photons are in short supply. Unfortunately, the performance 
does not yet achieve what is theoretically possible.

\begin{figure}[htb]
	\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.80\textwidth]{images/wide_flour_spher_All.jpg}
	\caption{Images of a $\unit[200]{nm}$ bead $\unit[67]{\upmu m}$ below the 
cover slip in a water/glycerol mixture with n = 1.42.  (a) Uncorrected image 
of in-focus plane. (b) Corrected image of in-focus plane. Images (c) and (d) 
are the same as (a) and (b), respectively, but on a logarithmic scale for 
better visualization. (e) and (f) are line profiles of the intensity through 
the center of the bead along the lateral and the longitudinal axis, 
respectively. The dashed line is from the uncorrected image and the solid 
line is from the corrected image. (g) and (h) are simulations of the PSF. 
Images based on \cite{wide_AOM_FM_spehrical_correction}.}
	\label{fig:wide_flour_spher_All} 
\end{figure}


The first is the effect of uncorrected aberrations from the sample and the 
optical path, which decrease the maximum intensity at the cover slip, but in 
a way that does not add linearly to the depth aberration. Thus only a 
fraction of the dispersed photons can be restored to the central peak. In 
closed loop AO systems, system aberrations are automatically compensated at 
each position (Wright et al., 2007), but in an open-loop system this is not 
possible. The second factor is the inability of the mirror to precisely 
conform to the shape given by Eq. (1). The residual error of the mirror shape 
increases with depth (see Fig. 3c) so that as the imaging plane goes deeper 
and the possibility for improvement becomes greater, the improvement in peak 
intensities decreases

Lastly, the ultimate goal of applying adaptive optics in microscopy is to 
correct all aberrations including those introduced by the refractive index 
variations of the sample itself.

\subsection{Point Scanning Microscopes}
\label{sec:PointScanningMicroscopes}

Scanning optical microscopes are widely used for high resolution imaging, 
mainly because certain implementations provide three-dimensional resolution 
with optical sectioning and are thus particularly useful for imaging the 
volume structures of biological specimensz. In these microscopes, 
illumination is provided by a laser that is focused by an objective lens into 
the specimen. The light emitted from the specimen is collected, usually 
through the same objective lens, and its intensity is measured by a single 
photodetector. The focal spot is scanned through the specimen in a raster 
pattern and the image is acquired in a point-by-point fashion. The resulting 
data are stored and rendered as images in a computer.

Several other point scanning microscope modalities have been introduced, 
including two-photon excitation uorescence (TPEF) microscopy, second harmonic 
generation (SHG) and third harmonic generation (THG) microscopy, and coherent 
anti-Stokes Raman (CARS) microscopy.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsubsection{Confocal Microscopes}
\label{sec:ConfocalMicroscopes}

The most common example of this type is the confocal microscope, which can be 
operated in reflection or fluorescence mode. Three-dimensional resolution is 
achieved by the placement of a pinhole in front of the photodetector. In a 
reflection mode confocal microscope, the illumination is scattered by objects 
not only in the focal region, but throughout the focusing cone. In 
fluorescence mode, emission is generated in the focus but also in out-of-
focus regions. The pinhole ensures that mainly light from the focal region 
falls upon the detector and light from out-of-focus planes is obscured. It is 
critical in the confocal microscope that both the illumination and detection 
paths are diffraction limited. This ensures that i) the illuminating focal 
spot is as small as possible, and ii) that the focus is perfectly imaged on 
to the detector pinhole. Therefore, in an adaptive confocal microscope, 
aberration correction must be included in both paths. This dual pass adaptive 
system can usually be implemented using a single deformable mirror, if the 
path length aberrations are the same for both the illumination and the 
emission light. This is the case if there is no significant dispersion in the 
specimen or chromatic aberration in the optics.

A pinhole is not required to obtain three-dimensional resolution, so most 
TPEF microscopes use large area detectors to maximise signal collection. 
Although they rely upon other physical processes, non-linear imaging 
modalities such as SHG, THG and CARS exhibit similar resolution properties. 
When using large area detectors, the fidelity of imaging in the detection 
path is unimportant so the effects of any aberrations in this path are 
negated. It follows that single pass adaptive optics is appropriate for these 
microscopes as aberration correction need only be implemented in the 
illumination path.

Adaptive optics systems have been successfully combined with several point-
scanning microscope systems including confocal,13 TPEF,6, 14, 15 harmonic 
generation,16, 17 CARS.18 Example images of aberration correction in an 
adaptive THG microscope are shown in Fig. 10.
